How to start trading stocks?

It's not complicated. 

Follow this plan, it’s made of three simple steps:
+ Earn money
+ Save money
+ Buy and sell stocks with your own saved money

That’s all. Three steps. Let’s discuss each one of them.

## Step 1: Earn Money

Your most valuable resources are your health and your time. They’re your gold. Protect them unapologetically. The quality of your life depends on them. Think about it for a second. Let it sink in.

Now that you’re fully aware of what resource you have, the next question that you should ask yourself is: what is the best way for you to convert them into another resource - money.

The simplest way to convert your time and your health into money is to acquire skills that other people are willing to pay you money for.

This is often called - getting a job.

Spend your time and health on learning and practicing skills that other people and businesses will pay you for.

How?

Here’s a list of things for you to do every single day:
+ Read a book or watch a course or hire an expert
+ Practice what you’ve read and what you’ve watched
+ Market your skills

Reading a book helps you to create new thoughts that you never had before in your mind. Those thoughts will create new questions. New questions will trigger you to find answers that will create new thoughts again. And so this process repeats until eventually you realise that now you understand something about this world that you didn’t understand earlier and what other people still don’t understand.

Yet, they’re willing to pay you for that understanding, if and only if, you can apply it in the real world and create value.

Theory is only useful when you are capable of putting it into practice. That’s why it’s not enough to read a book about an idea. You then need to apply that idea in the real world and see what value you can create and whether other people are willing to pay money for it.

Go put your newly learned theory into practice. Acquire valuable real-world experience.

With knowledge and experience under your belt you are ready to provide value to people in exchange for their money.

Except nobody knows about this yet.

You believe there are people in this world, in your country, in your city who are looking for people with the skills like yours?

Help them to find you:
+ Find what these people are paying attention to
+ Make yourself noticeable
+ Explain who you are and what do you offer

For example, if you’re looking to be found by recruiters in your city, then one of the potential places where they’re spending their time is LinkedIn.

Go on LinkedIn, create an account and fill it with all the details that are relevant to who you are, what skills do you offer and what you’re looking for.

Connect with recruiters, discuss job opportunities, prepare and go to interviews and get the best paying job that you can.

This is the end of the step one - you’re now earning money.

## Step 2: Save Money

Life is not free. It costs money. The more money you have, the better life you can afford.

Yet, you want to spend as little money as you can and save as much money as you can.

Making money is not enough. You need to save what you make. You can’t save all 100% of your income, because life is not free, but you can save some part of your income. And the more you can save - the better.

Design a lifestyle that you can tolerate and that allows you to save as much as possible. Choose the cheapest rent. Share your flat with other people. Buy essential groceries and cook your own meals at home. Invite friends over. Don’t buy TV. Don’t watch TV. Don’t watch Netflix. Buy and read books. Write about what you read. Think about what you read.  

You saved your money. You’re now ready to buy and sell stocks to make more money.

## Step 3: Buy and sell stocks with your own saved money

When you’re buying a stock you’re exchanging money for shares in a company.
When you’re selling a stock you’re exchanging shares in a company for money.

These two activities are what is called stock trading. You trade money for shares and shares for money.

Now that you have a choice - to hold your money or hold shares in a company - which one would you choose?

Money is a way to store value. Company shares are another way to store value. The challenge is that that value always changes. It never stays the same.

You can take a look at the $100 dollar bill today. You can take a look at the same $100 dollar bill tomorrow. It’s the same $100 dollar bill. It won’t look different to you. Yet, yesterday it stored one value and today it stores different value. The bill itself didn’t change. It’s value did.

That’s the key property of value storages - the value that they store changes over time. And that’s what we can benefit from by exchanging those value storages with each other in the hope to end with the storage that stores the most value.

The value of money can go up. The value of money can go down.
The value of company shares can go up. The value of company shares can go down.

You want to own something that goes up over time in value.

How so you know? You do your research.

And then you make a bet.

If you bet on the event that company shares will go up in value in the future, then you exchange your money for those shares, because you’re also making a bet that your money won’t go as much up in value as those shares that you’re buying. You buy stock.

If you bet on the event that company shares will go down in value in the future, then you don’t buy them or you sell them.

Yes, stock trading is betting on the future events. For profits, all while taking risks.

How do you buy and sell shares?
You need to open a stock trading account with a stock trading broker.

I use three different brokers in the UK:
+ [Freetrade](https://freetrade.io/freeshare?code=HXL1PCFK0N&sender=YxfmwwRA)
+ [Trading 212](http://www.trading212.com/invite/FMXVupQC)
+ [InteractiveBrokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.co.uk/)

[Freetrade](https://freetrade.io/freeshare?code=HXL1PCFK0N&sender=YxfmwwRA) is the easiest and the cheapest out of all three to use. Once you open an account with them, the next step is to deposit your saved money.

And this is an extremely important point that I want you to remember - only risk the amount of money that you’re comfortable losing. In theory you can lose all your money in stock trading. The chances of that might be low or high, depending on what you buy and when you buy it. But always consider the worst case scenario. Will your lifestyle significantly change if you lose all your money in stock trading? If the answer is no, then you’re good to go. If the answer is yes, then you need to rethink how much money you’re willing to risk.

Only trade with the amount of money that you’re willing to lose.

Once you have the money in your account, you can choose the company which shares you want to buy and then - buy them. It’s that simple.

Congratulations! Now you’re a “shareholder” - you hold company shares. You own a piece of that company now. It’s official.

The next step is wait and see what will happen in the future - in an hour, tomorrow, the next month or the next year - it’s up to you when you want to sell your shares.

How long are you willing to wait? How much profit are you expecting to make?

Make a plan. Try to follow that plan. Get experience and learn from it.

Stock trading is not an easy ride, but it’s a fun one.
