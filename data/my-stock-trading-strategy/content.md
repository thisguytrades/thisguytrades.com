# My Stock Trading Strategy

_First things first: this is not financial advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only._

It's important to decide how you will trade stocks before you start trading stocks. Choose the time when you make rational, logical, informed decisions, when your emotions don't get in a way.

When you have a stock trading plan in place, you're less affected by the emotions that you'll feel when the stock market goes up and down.

And it will go up and down. Unpredictably. Irrationally.

Here are the things that you need to decide on before you start buying shares:
1. When do want to sell: the best case and the worst case.
2. What profit you would like to get: the best case and the worst case.
3. Can you afford to lose some or all of your invested money?

Here's one of the strategies that I use when I trade stocks.

## Step 1

Buy a small number of shares in the stock that you want to trade.

## Step 2

When the share price goes down and your portfolio is in red, i.e. it is now worth less than what you have paid originally - buy more shares.

Look at the new lower price as a discount. You would buy these shares at the original price, but now the price is lower and you're getting a discount.

When you're buying more at the lower price, your average price that you've paid per share is decreasing. This is called Dollar-Cost Averaging or DCA strategy.

Repeat this until your portfolio is in green, i.e. it is now worth more than what you have paid originally, or until you run out of money and you can't buy more shares even at a lower prices.

## Step 3

When your portfolio is in green, but it's not worth enough for you sell it for a desired profit, then hold your shares. Don't buy and don't sell any shares. Just wait.

## Step 4

When the price goes down, i.e. it dips - buy more shares. The bigger the dip, the more shares you should buy.

## Step 5

When your worst desired return is reached, start selling slowly.

## Step 6

When your best desired return is reached, start selling faster until all is sold.

## Step 7

Never sell for loss, unless the company's fundamentals have changed, i.e. the company has changed over time so dramatically, that you don't expect to make your desired profits anymore.

That's all.
