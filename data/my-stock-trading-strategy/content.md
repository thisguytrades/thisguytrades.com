# My Stock Trading Strategy

_First things first: this is not financial advice. This is for educational and entertainment purposes only._


## Step 1

Buy a small number of shares in the stock that you want to trade.

## Step 2

When in red, DCA every day until in green.

## Step 3

When in green, but haven't reached the desired return - hold.

## Step 4

Buy the dip, the bigger the dip, the bigger your buy order.

## Step 5

When expected worst annual return is reached, start selling slowly.

## Step 6

When expected best annual return is reached, start selling faster.

## Step 7

Never sell for loss, unless company's fundamentals change.

And that's all.
