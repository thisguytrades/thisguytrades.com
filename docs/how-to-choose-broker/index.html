This is for educational and entertainment purposes only.</em></p><p>To trade stocks on a stock market, you need a broker.</p><p>How do you choose a broker?</p><p>There are three steps that I follow when I choose my broker.</p><h2>Step 1: Make a list of the most popular brokers in your country</h2><p>Use Google to find out who are the most popular stock trading brokers in your country.</p><h2>Step 2: Filter out brokers who don't participate in FSCS</h2><p>In the UK investors have <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/">FSCS: Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a> that covers <a href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/investments/">investments up to £85,000</a>.</p><p>FSCS should, in theory, compensate you up to £85,000 if your broker <a href="https://moneyweek.com/488411/paying-to-get-your-shares-back">goes out of business</a>.</p><p>This means if you choose a broker who participates in FSCS, you'll choose less risk. On the other hand, if you choose a broker who doesn't participate in FSCS - you'll choose more risk.</p><p>I choose to use only brokers who participates in FSCS.</p><h2>Step 3: Rank brokers by how much fees they charge you</h2><p>Brokers can charge you fees for their services. Sort your brokers by the amount of fees they're charging and go with one who changes no feel or low fees.</p><p>Broker fees will affect your profits, so it's beneficial for you to go with a broker who changes you no fees.</p><h2>Recommendations</h2><p>I use two different brokers in the UK that are covered by FSCS:</p><ul><li><a href="https://freetrade.io/freeshare?code=HXL1PCFK0N&sender=YxfmwwRA">Freetrade</a> - I am an investor and a user. Follow the link to get a free share.</li><li><a href="http://www.trading212.com/invite/FMXVupQC">Trading 212</a> - I am a user. Follow the link to get a free share.</li></ul><p>I recommend starting with <a href="https://freetrade.io/freeshare?code=HXL1PCFK0N&sender=YxfmwwRA">Freetrade</a> as it is the easiest and the cheapest one to use in the UK at the time of writing this post.</p><p>They charge £0 fees.</p><h2>Why you should use multiple brokers</h2><p>If you're in the UK, and the amount of money that you want to trade with is greater than £85,000, then you might want to use multiple brokers that participate in FSCS. FSCS protects £85,000 per financial firm, which means if you use multiple financial firms, that is - multiple brokers - then you'll get protection from FSCS for more than £85,000.</p><h2>Other things to consider</h2><p>Not all brokers offer the same services. For example, some brokers might not offer shares for companies that you might want to trade. In that case, you'll have to look for alternative brokers.</p><p>That's all.</p><p>Leave a comment if you have any follow up questions or get in touch with me via email: <a href="mailto:thisguytrades@gmail.com">thisguytrades@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Follow me on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisguytrades/">@ThisGuyTrades</a></p></div></div><div class="add-this-sharing-buttons"><!-- Go to www.addthis.com/dashboard to customize your tools --><div class="addthis_sharing_toolbox"></div></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function() {
